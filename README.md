# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Support--Vector-machine
This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The program was trained and tested on a cleaned and balanced dataset from Kaggle called “Breast Cancer Wisconsin” . A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to achieve an accuracy of 0.956140350877193 . The dataset was cleaned and balanced by the author before training the model. The SVM classifier was chosen due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in binary classification problems . The program takes in various features of a patient’s breast mass such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension . These features were used to train the SVM model and predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The program achieved an accuracy of 0.956140350877193 in detecting breast cancer . However, there are still areas for improvement such as using more advanced machine learning techniques or incorporating more features into the model. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in detecting breast cancer and can be used as a starting point for further research in this area.
