# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Support--Vector-machine
This project uses machine learning to detect breast cancer with an accuracy of 0.956 using a cleaned and balanced dataset from Kaggle called “Breast Cancer Wisconsin”. The program takes in various features of a patient’s breast mass to train an SVM model for binary classification.
